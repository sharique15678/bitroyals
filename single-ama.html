              Amarnath | Nord Finance: <br />
              Nord finance is an advanced decentralized financial ecosystem
              designed to simplify DeFi investing by bringing key features of
              traditional finance to the DeFi ecosystem. We want to be an

              At Nord Finance, we are building a one-stop advanced decentralized
              financial ecosystem for its user’s investments to meet their
              financial goals. Within the Nord Finance ecosystem, we are
              building 4 key products: <br />
              <br />
              Key Products <br />

              Nord.Advisory: Risk profile based Robo Advisory <br />
              Nord.Loans: Overdraft crypto loans/loans against portfolio <br />

              Nord.Savings: <br />
              Allows optimizing returns through a multi-chain yield-farming
              mechanism for stable coin farming with the highest possible
              risk-adjusted returns. To maximize returns, the protocol employs
              the highest risk-adjusted APY’s. Whereas it leverages the DeFi
              Score framework to assess and analyze the dynamics of protocol
              risks. Nord.Savings provides a seamless interface to access the
              world of DeFi-based yield farming effortlessly without any
              technical implications as the traditional financial counterparts.

              over-collateralized loan is quite uncluttered and hassle-free.
              This is a smart alternative to borrowing loans without liquidating
              the crypto assets to meet financial obligations. It also offers a
              personal overdraft facility with the benefit of paying interest
              while withdrawing the amount. <br />

              First question from twitter <br />
              <br />

              is very high. What do u think about this & can u be sure that ur
              project product will be in demand in the long term? $Nord are
              there any plans to contribute to DeFi’s development? <br />
              <br />
              From @ashes204bd <br />
              <br />

              <br />
              Aryan Soni | Crypto royals CM: <br />
              Second question from twitter <br />
              <br />
              Every project has an interesting story before it is created. So,
              can you tell people a story that gives you the motivation to build
              and develop a great project like yours? <br />
              <br />
              From @gapuakjang <br />
              <br />
              Amarnath | Nord Finance: <br />
              We believe the brand name should truly represent the purpose of
              the brand. With that thought, we felt that as we evolve our
              brand-name should evolve with us. As we searched for our new
              brand-name, NORD resonated with our core objectives:
              Inclusiveness, Community Governance, Maximization & Security.

              <br />
              Aryan Soni | Crypto royals CM: <br />
              Third question from twitter <br />
              <br />
              Is there any reward mechanism for holding NORD ？What are the
              benefits of Holding NORD ? <br />
              <br />
              From @Prasadperaka <br />
              <br />
              Amarnath | Nord Finance: <br />
              $NORD token has various utilities in the Nord Finance financial
              ecosystems: <br />
              <br />
              Liquidity Mining: In order for the Nord Finance ecosystem to
              function properly, users would need to be incentivised to play the
              role of liquidity providers and stake their digital assets into
              the market making pools. As compensation for opportunity costs as
              well as impermanent losses, these liquidity providers which help
              to promote adoption of the Nord Finance ecosystem by staking or
              including assets to liquidity pools would be rewarded with $NORD
              tokens (i.e. liquidity “mining” programs on the Nord Finance
              ecosystem), according to each user’s relative contribution after
              various adjustment and correction parameters. <br />

              Incentivizing programs: Users can earn $NORD token incentives by
              participating in the platform, for example trading/exchanging, or
              development of new strategies for the vault.
              <br />
              Distributing Fee Rewards: In order to stimulate participation in
              the platform , $NORD token will be distributed as rewards to users
              for various contests and community giveaways. <br />
              <br />
              Community governance incentives: The $NORD token holders will
              earnestly participate in the protocol’s governance by voting on
              various proposals regarding product upgrades. Users will be
              required to stake their $NORD tokens in the staking program to
              participate in governance and vote on proposals, and as a reward
              they will be able to earn additional $NORD tokens proportionate to
              their contributions. <br />
              <br />
              Service fees: For the services rendered a small fee/profit share
              would be charged by the protocol in $NORD. These fees will be
              retained in the protocol treasury. <br />
              <br />
              Cross Chain Settlement: Using the $NORD token as the base platform
              currency, $NORD will expedite digital asset swaps between
              compatible blockchain seamlessly. <br />
              <br />
              we are soon launching NORD staking rewards program on BSC as well
              <br />

              Forth questions from twitter <br />
              <br />
              Nord Finance is built on the Ethereum Network. We all know
              Ethereum’s transaction fees are very high, and sometimes it makes
              investors lazy about this. how do you deal with this? what
              strategies do you have for attracting investors? <br />
              <br />
              @langitberwarna <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              Amarnath | Nord Finance: Ethereum still has the most DeFi
              liquidity so we have to launch our protocol on Ethereum first , I
              agree on the fee part which is a main hurdle for small investors
              to interact . <br />
              <br />
              we are aggressively working on to launch on BSC and Matic <br />
              <br />
              Our BSC protocol is completed beta testing with no major issues
              and is under audit for a while . We will be live on BSC very soon.
              <br />
              <br />
              NORD staking is coming on BSC with low fees. <br />
              <br />
              While we are waiting for BSC audit report , we have already built
              to launch on Polygon ( Matic) as well . We are making final
              internal checks before we go to public. <br />
              <br />
              Aryan Soni | Crypto royals CM: <br />
              Fifth question from twitter <br />
              <br />
              Too many projects promise magic but never release any working
              product or prove any revenue, Within a short/long time of release.
              Is your project also like this? If not can u tell us, What makes
              your project different from other projects? <br />
              <br />
              From @AriyanKhanJim1 <br />
              <br />
              Amarnath | Nord Finance: <br />
              Like I said earlier we are focused to build product , thats our
              first and foremost priority <br />
              <br />
              We are well inline with our road map and been consistently giving
              product updates to our community . We believe in building user
              friendly products and work rigorously to achieve the same. Few
              things which are not under our control can cause little delay ,
              like our BSC audit . However we better wait for fully audited
              protocol for the safety of user funds. <br />

              very good question , as part of our revenue modle we have some %
              of fund used to buyback our own token and move the same to tresury
              . This will help us to believe in accumulating our own token and
              indirectly help to lock circulation supply from the market .<br />

              Could you please tell me about the Nord Finance team and some of
              their backgrounds? I have personally seen many projects launch
              with inexperienced team members, and some of those didn’t go so
              well due to easily avoidable mistakes.<br />
